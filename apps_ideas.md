## BILLOW (Working Title?)

### App Description
Find and list commercial space for businesses, large or small. This app is like a Zillow for commercial properties, whether you need a small office at a co-working space or more traditional space for your organization or workshop, *Billow* will help you find your next workspace. 

### App Idea Evaluation
- **Category** Business to Business Communication/Marketplace
- **Mobile** Phone and tablet usage for commercial real estate shoppers and sellers to list, find, and rent/buy properties in areas based on location search. 
- **Story** Commercial real estate sales and transaction search that focuses on comps from property sales, refinancing, transfers, and tax billings as well as seller uploaded information. All properties shown by list or map location. Tapping on properties reveals sales asking price or last transaction type, details and price (total/per unit/per square foot). Details for all commercial property types: office, retail, industrial, multifamily apartments, hotels, senior housing and development sites, co-working space.
- **Market** Commercial real estate investors/owners and businesses looking for new locations.
- **Habit** 
1. This app would allow commerical real estate seekers to have a one-stop app to find new listings as well as comparing those listings to adjacent and nearby property values. 
2. This app would allow commerical real estate sellers to have a one-stop app to create new listings as well as comparing those listings to adjacent and nearby property values. 
- **Scope** This app will be location-based with the primary window being a map - alternate list view. Users would be able to search commercial properties based on zip/city/drawn area. Properties display at least street view as well as other photos uploaded by owners/agents. Pulling data from national commercial real estate databases, city/county/state open records search results (tax valuation, ownership, last sales price, etc.) - Extras could include current property valuation, neighborhood stats (crime, amount of commercial space, percentage of residential, commerical, industrial zoning in area, etc).

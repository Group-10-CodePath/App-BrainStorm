### Twitter

Twitter started as a way to get quick updates from entertainment or news outlets.

- **Scope:** Spotify came out during the time where Pandora dominated the music streaming market. Pandora was a radio app that did not allow you to pick which song you wanted to listen to. Spotify made it available to find and stream specific songs. This app would require the ability to handle streaming audio to millions of users as well as store their personal playlists. Music licensing would also need to be taken into consideration; how will artist get paid for opting to have their music as part of this service?

## New App Ideas
1. Rental Marketplace - Similar to Facebook marketplace; however, instead of selling/buying things, you can rent them. For example, if you have an item (e.g. boat, rv, kayak, set of skis, set of golf clubs, table saw, 4-wheeler, etc.) that you don't want to sell, but that you don't use often, you can rent it out for a day/week/month/etc. People who need an item for a day, but don't want to buy it can rent.
